## Technologies used

- Google Firebase
- Zapier
- Google Auth
- Stripe
- Flutter

## Example usage

## Future work

I would like to try partnering with bars to see this application really come to life. I would also like to improve the appearance of the app with time as well as update all the SDKs in order to fix security vulnerabilites.  

Additionally, this has only been tested on older devices (7+ years old) with decent performance, so I'd like to test it on newer phones to get a better indication of performance and how much optimization would be required.
